Title: Tools We Use at Work

Here are some of the tools we use every day at work, at JÃ³nsson & Le'macks.

#### Google Apps

We migrated our calendar and email from an in house OS X Server about four months ago, to Google Apps. The file-share is still in-house. The AFP server is just too flawless, fast and reliable to switch to any cloud based solution. We're moving everyone off iCal to the web based Google Calendar to use the advanced features. iPhone integration is really nice as Google Apps can masquerade as an Exchange server. Most everyone has an iPhone at work.

#### File storage and sharing

Our video department works off their own SAN. The digital department uses an S3 compatible account on [GreenQloud](http://www.greenqloud.com/) to serve video for Flash banners and highly available assets. Basically a poor man's CDN. 

I'm currently developing an in-house auto-index type site for password protected file delivery. Email attachments suck, and again, cloud based sharing is too much of a pain currently. We like to mount AFP shares and upload *fast*.

Dropbox is a big letdown lately. I sort of expected them to lower their prices and streamline the UI and sharing process. Lots of businesses are looking for a better solution here. We'd love to have an improved Dropbox interface with transparent pricing and auto-archiving features.

#### [GitHub](http://www.github.com/)

All our code is hosted on GitHub. It's very intuitive to administer the organization accounts for things like bringing in freelance developers and later revoking their access. If your commits are frequent and good it can become a poor man's time tracker too. GitHub is about so much more than code, it's the social layer of code too. I'm more of a Mercurial guy, finding the git command line tool absurd in comparison. It's a shame Bitbucket didn't win out. I'm looking into using hg-git.

#### [Flow](http://www.getflow.com/)

Streamlined project management web app with clients for Mac and iPhone. I've tried a dozen different GTD apps, but this one wins out. It's like a friendly GitHub issues app. Very social and connected. The usage is intuitive, especially considering it's depth. The advanced features present themselves as you learn. We're still evaluating this for use with the whole studio. The optional complexity is a brilliant touch, sort of how Gmail's star feature works. Everyone has their own rules for what a star really signifies. Flow has that touch. In fact we should be using it for way more stuff.

#### [Traffic](http://www.sohnar.com/)

An agency time tracking, billing and invoicing application (or platform I should say). Developed in FileMaker, seemingly in the age of Macintosh Color Classic. Evaluated [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/) as a replacement but wasn't up to scratch. Harvest looks to be attracting smaller studios with a few clients, uninterested in making it more complicated to serve bigger agencies I guess. I don't blame them. Apparently the guys behind Traffic are working on a super awesome modern version of Traffic that's built on Adobe Air. Nice move from one shitty platform to the next. Recording your times at the end of the month is as painful as slamming your privates on a George Forman. 

#### [HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com/)

This one has potential, but it'll be hard getting the whole studio onboard. HipChat is IRC for businesses, with history and a bunch of friendly features. It's got that `@mention` thing like Twitter, guest invites, image link preview and more. I suspect this might work out for geekier workplaces, probably not ours. Ideally you could split the office into client groups and get everyone to join a room for each group. If you catch up with discussions in your room a couple of times a day people will be more aware of related projects around them, and could pitch in a comment or two to help out. That's the up side at least, having casual back-and-forth's you would not otherwise have. The big bonus is working with headphones or in completely different location. GitHub does Campfire, a very similar tool, to allow the flexibility of working from any place at any time.

In my sysadmin wet dream, all inhouse systems would be integrated into a HipChat bot. A sort of hub for all activity. The amount of noise that goes on in a chat room can go quite high while remaining non-frustrating, unlike other more demanding mediums.

#### iChat

iChat get's a lot of mileage within the office. Bonjour chat is cool and dummyproof.

#### Keynote

Occasionally we'll turn to InDesign for things with shelve-life. Great tool. We even do wireframes in Keynote. For a great wireframe package get the [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) iconography and use them sparingly but cleverly in Keynote.

### BONUS / Nerdy stuff I use

#### [Sublime Text 2](www.sublimetext.com/2)

After years of waiting for TextMate 2, I decided to give Sublime Text 2 out for a week. Three weeks have passed since then, the TextMate author finally coughs up promise to deliver an Alpha by Christmas. Sublime Text 2 has a lot of momentum by now and I suggest you give it a try if you're a TextMate user.

#### [Notation Velocity](http://notational.net/)

A frontend to [SimpleNote](http://www.simplenoteapp.com/) that syncs RTF style notes and makes them searchable. iPhone and iPad clients available too. Great, secure notes setup.

#### [Scrup](https://github.com/rsms/scrup)

An impressive little tool. It wraps the Command+Shift+4 OS X screenshot utility in a configurable file uploader. You'll need to host your own receiver. The moneyshot is the automatic "URL in clipboard" feature. I use this utility at least once a day.

#### Alfred

A just-works launcher for OS X.

### BONUS / Some Notes on Word Processing

I don't use typical word processors like Pages or Microsoft Word. I go straight to Markdown for authoring, or lately more and more to [Substance.io](http://substance.io) which shows great potential and is defining a new niche for document structuring, collaboration and sharing. Like a GitHub for documents. 

I tend to spend a lot of time formatting and rewriting emails in Mail.app. I'm a proponent of email etiquette, brevity and clarity. 

I bought byWord, a Markdown aware focus editor which I'm using right now. It has all the new OS X Lion features, a word count and beautiful interface.
