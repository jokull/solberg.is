Title: Lying

> The future of social media is lying. As more and more services close their grip upon who we know, where we are, and what we're doing, we'll come to the sobering realization that we're just not that interesting. We'll create personas to travel the world, meet interesting people, solve crimes and rescue kittens from burning houses. 'Who you are' has never been as interesting as 'who you pretend to be'. The future of social media is the frontier of a new fiction, and one that we can be an active, and sometimes unwilling participant in. We don't want real identities, we want really good identities.

Great insight. I love that people in advertising are obsessively observant just to see half a step further into the future.
