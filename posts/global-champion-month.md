Title: 30 Day Challenge - The Global Champion Month

Just short of a year ago I partook in a quasi-global movement nicknamed The Global Champion Month. This year I am helping out by designing and building the official website. Last year the event was coordinated by some friends of mine and I was one of many who attempted to live by the ways of a true champion. No alcohol, waking up early, eating 90% paleo and training the hardest I've ever done. Most people presented their progress in a blog diary of some sort. It was a true community effort that inspired many more people to try a similar challenge.

Every weekday I woke up at 6:30, grabbed a fruit and showed up at a local CrossFit gym. The mornings became a routine that defined the rest of the day. Doing a crushing workout and devouring a healthy breakfast before sunrise seems to secrete some sort of champion hormone to the rest of your body. Ones mind and body is ready for challenges. It was a completely new experience for me.

Eating the way you've evolved to eat had many surprising side effects. The most notable was an even blood sugar. The blood sugar crashes I was accustomed to went away. Heartburn was gone as well, but best of all, when the month finished I knew a ton about nutrition and my own responses. Cleaning up a diet and adding foods back in slowly should be the first order of business if you haven't done so.

22 November we're launching the next Champion Month challenge and everyone's invited. It's still an Icelandic affair, but hit us with a mention on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/meistaramanudur) to let us know if you're interested.
