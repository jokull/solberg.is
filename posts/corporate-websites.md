Title: Designing the corporate website

Today I saw a great example of web design at [FeeFighters.com](http://feefighters.com/). Fee Fighters is a startup with a very focused product. Some of the pros: 

+ Their site can afford putting that one solution in the spotlight. 
+ They've got clear CTA's (call to action). 
+ The screenshots are carefully picked so you know what to expect if you buy in. 
+ Testemonials are from people that have a voice in the industry. 

Startups have it easy when it comes to web design. Make a pretty web version of the elevator speech. Larger companies with a portfolio of solutions have a harder time presenting themselves online. Here are some common reasons I can think of:

+ They don't make a conversion online (their sales are offline, possibly business to business), hence the CTA's are unclear or unexciting. 
+ The customer segmentation is so great that the tone of voice and language is all over the place.
+ Their marketing budget is big. Big marketing budgets have a tendency to create lofty messages. The "create a better world" campaign gets the spotlight and doesn't do anyone any favors.

Unlike a typical startup there is no competent internal tech team to manage the site. They're probably running one of those crappy CMS's too, and the e-commerce part is hosted as a seperate solution making it even harder to integrate the right elements at the right places in the design.
