Title: Good Curry That to Me Looks and Tastes Authentic And Reminds One of a Proper LAHORE Curry House

Serves 5

+ 1 tsp fennel seeds
+ 1 tsp cumin seeds
+ 1 tsp coriander seeds
+ 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
+ 1 cardamom pod
+ 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled
+ 3 red onions, chopped
+ 5 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
+ 2 red chillies chopped
+ 1 tbsp olive oil
+ 1.5 kg lamb shanks (somewhere around 4 shanks)
+ 75g butter
+ 1x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
+ 2 tbsp tomato purée
+ 350ml vegetable stock
+ Rice, mint and yoghurt to serve with

Warm up the spices on a pan to release the oils. Mmm. Throw in a mortar and pestle and crush, or spread on a cutting board and whack the spices with a pan. Point is to break all the kernels apart.

Prepare meat by cutting away unwanted bits. Make sure to keep all the fat around though. Just debone and cut meat into finger sized pieces.

In a blender or with a magic wand thing, blend onions, garlic, spices and chilli until you get a smooth paste. Heat a pan with butter and combine, on the pan, with the curry paste. When whole kitchen smells with curry aromas, move pan off heat and prepare a new one to brown meat in oil. 

While browning prepare stock if you don't have it at hand. Dissolve a vegetable cube in warm water. 

In a casserole combine meat, curry paste, tomatoes and purée. Whack in the oven at 180° for 2.5 hours. If you have a pressure cooker you can get away with less.

Serve with rice, mint and yoghurt.
