Title: Making an Ad vs. Owning the Channel

Plain advertising constructs a message, produces it eyecatchingly and buys the real estate to display it. The message is guesswork - as in; part of a doubtless imperfect strategy, with a target group and product usage in mind. This set of promotion of products, values and ideas is not going away. We need to start somewhere and that's more or less what we're going to do, conceptualize the message and deliver in a compelling, possibly entertaining way. But as soon as the lifecycle of a product or, perhaps the emotional connection to a brand begins, we need to be on our feet.

There is already a desire of brands to control and own the new channels. Facebook Pages and Twitter hashtags are good examples. A little piece of the interactive social pie. I'm not necessarily talking about Nike owning a social network. Well if successfully pulled off that wouldn't be so bad. But we can be more creative than that. Think of the frequently referenced Old Spice campaign. The spontaneousness of that campaign transferred into a proximity to consumers. A beautiful example of creating the channel with traditional advertising and then capitalizing on the reactions and emotions that rippled. We should have a long term strategy in place too. The sought after "brand fans" are little promotional engines and deserve to be praised and promoted themselves.
