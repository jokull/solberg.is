Title: Introduction

I have enjoyed Tweeting for some time, and more frequently I find myself wanting to express myself beyond the character limit. My fear is that in the future I will look back at these posts and shake my head in disbelief at how stupid my ideas were and how poorly I communicated them. Then I am reminded of Ira Glass' thoughts on **taste** and not quite getting to where you want to be artistically and professionally at first. His point was that, just this fact, that the creator frustrates over the imperfections and revealing flaws, shows that the creator knows where he *wants* to be. 

I am going to be choosing my words too carefully, then not carefully enough. I am going to be too brief, then too wordy. I am going for grandiose when I should be going for humor and wit. I am going to repeat myself when the point has already been made all too well.
