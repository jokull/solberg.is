Title: Your medium sized business' website

As the technical lead for a creative agency I oversee many corporate website designs. We are often asked which CMS to pick. I believe the tools we currently know as CMS's are faulty and prohibit good practices and aesthetics.

### "We must be able to update everything"

Clients have varying requirements. Part of our job is to realize what requirements make sense. We have to balance out technical obstacles, billings and the clients' priorities. From the design angle, we are responsible for delivering a design that does not require the client to commit time and resources to updates, unless it's worthwhile. Some news sections are updated every few months. The design of a website governs it's content strategy. Most clients ask us for a CMS that can update everything. We must explain at what cost that would come, short term and long term.

### First time visitors vs. Returning visitors

In order to get returning visitors, you must give them a reason to come back. People only come back if they believe there is something new and attractive going on. Even then they would probably prefer to be **notified** of updates instead of estimating the frequency of updates and making a mental note to return at a suitable moment in time. Hence we have the success of newsletters, Twitter and Facebook fan pages. 

I suggest the general guideline to make the best possible *first impression*. For most clients putting this on top will produce a web site that has the longest lifetime. If your message and content strategy has a realistic chance at building a base of repeat visitors use a platform that is suited for such content. This could be a product development blog, some cheeky Tweets or a newsletter for your most loyal fans. In any case, a CMS is not going to cover your needs. The current breed of blogging platforms allow you to customize templates and host on a domain of your choice. Tumblr and Posterous both offer these features free of charge. They're almost certain to have a better interface then your CMS blog module. Stick your blog on blog.yourbrand.com, ask your agency to provide a custom look and theme. Voila. No training required, and a medium the visitor **gets** right away.

### Only update your website manually once a year ...

... and do it through an agency. Let your pages be crafted presentations with just the right tone and a lifetime. Your website is too important to let the CMS butcher it.

### But a CMS can't hurt can it?

It constrains the design. Any time a designer has to ask "why can't the breakfast menu be split into columns" or "why can't the illustration cover the top section" it calls for a compromise. Pick the choice that leaves the best first impression.
