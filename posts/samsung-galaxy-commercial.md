I got some replies from Android users who took it personally. They're my friends, so of course I wanted to elaborate on my point.

1. I'm not saying consumers would be wrong to get an iPhone or a Samsung. I'm just talking about the message the piece of advertisement is conveying. Samsung is trying to reach people who find "creatives" childish and blinded by the Apple marketing machine. It's saying "hey be rational, look at the specs"; completely dodging the much more important marketing points about the ecosystem today's mobile devices live in: app store, app developers, THEN the device specs. They all play together and Samsung knows they only have one of the three in the bag.
2. 90% of people in the market for a new phone are going to want a smartphone or not. For the definition of a smartphone user let's go with: someone who uses the technology in smartphones and not others. I'm going to play my risqu√© card and say that in general, Android users are not smartphone users. Tweeting, hobby photography, browsing etc. Statistics back this up, both in the app store sales and numerous site reports about mobile browser statistics.
