Title: Books

The reading experience on Kindle for iPad is surprisingly pleasant. You can point and hold your finger over a word to get its dictionary definition. Only a second away, displayed at the bottom of the screen. An especially clever sentence can be highlighted and shared on Twitter or Facebook. Instantly. It's like that impulse you get when your reading a book on a sunday afternoon with your girlfriend somewhere around and you pause to share something enlightening or relevant. But this time it's archived too so your Amazon Highlights Page accumulates these places and highlights from the book.

I think I prefer it this way, over printed books or the e-ink Kindle. Also, excited to see if these features are all in the new Kindle Fire.

This brings up an exciting idea. What if authors could choose to charge a little extra for the book, but readers can redeem up to a certain value percentage of the book by sharing sentences with their social networks? This way authors of good books can get rewarded, presumably, by bigger sales numbers as the reading experience turns into target advertising. I think it could work out quite nicely.
