Title: Nutrition pt. 1

I have a moderately good track record of keeping fit, did gymnastics and football among other things as a kid, had my slacker years as a teen but now practice CrossFit non-religiously two to three times a week. I did a couple of months of jiu-jitsu earlier this year and now I'm doing a course in MovNat. During my 30 day champion challenge last year I moved into near-overtraining mode with 5 WOD's a week. CrossFit 5 times a week for 30 days was a great way to move my technique and conditioning to a new level, but not something to maintain.

Training sets some mental food cog into motion. Fitness is a pursuit that relies and benefits from good nutrition. So you could say my interest in nutrition was ignited and initially driven by CrossFit. I quickly picked up [The Paleo Solution](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paleo-Solution-Robb-Wolf/dp/0982565844/ref=as_li_tf_mfw?&camp=2486&linkCode=wey&tag=wo0e1-21&creative=8878) and immediately started preaching the ways of a caveman lifestyle and diet. The 30 day paleo challenge had these notable results:

+ No blood sugar crashes, even energy and focus throughout the day
+ No [heartburn](http://chriskresser.com/heartburn), something I'd experienced with slight discomfort
+ Always hungry
+ I confirmed my suspicion, I have gluten intolerance
+ Good skin, good food

I quickly added dairy, and referred to it as *lacto-paleo*<sup>1</sup>. I love dairy and it helped with satiety and cooking. Dairy in Iceland is cheap and tasty too, so it's a no brainer for Scandinavians unless you have problems with dairy. If you suspect it may be problematic, wait out the 30 days and then add it back in.

At the end of the month I switched gears a bit, introducing occasional cheats at good moments, potatoes and rice. But generally, armed with new knowledge about my responses I adopted the 80/20 rule<sup>2</sup>. I try to optimize my food choices for long term happiness, but knowing what those choices are requires that you experiment and actually know something about food toxins and nutrition, in the same way someone decides to give up smoking based on the long term negative effects. 

A new 30 day champ challenge is coming up. I don't know what changes to look out for, as I'm pretty happy as I am now. There is no hypothesis, if so to speak. 

### Ban list (a.k.a. food toxins)

For the lowdown on food toxins see Chris Kresser's [9 Steps to Perfect Health - #1: Don’t Eat Toxins](http://chriskresser.com/9-steps-to-perfect-health-1-dont-eat-toxins). This is the rough cut of my ban list.

#### Sugar

Except in whole fruit or occasional honey for cooking or very dark chocolate. **No fruit juice**, cakes or sweets. 

#### Grains

Cutting out grains was a great move for me last year. I've added it slowly back in. I seem to handle small amounts of very buttery bread quite well, but some types of bread and larger amounts are especially inflammatory. For the 30 day Champ Challenge I may have a croissant on weekends. 

#### Processed Soy, Industrial Oils

Omega-6 rich oils are out in favor of healthier oils. I might set some butter eating record. Read [Chris Kresser's guide](http://chriskresser.com/9-steps-to-perfect-health-2-nourish-your-body) for the lowdown on oils.

#### Coffee

Not a toxin, but for me a big mood and energy imbalancer. I experience crashes and mood swings I don't care for. I'll have a burst of productivity, but then crash into [anxiousness and impatience](http://blissbat.net/balzac.html). PG tips tea will be my go-to hand-warmer, with 20% heavy cream or unpasteurized milk.

### Natural Foods

For the 30 days I will prefer and seek out cultural and nutritionally dense foods. Icelanders have a heritage of super-foods that have been ignored, industrialized and ruined. Cod liver oil, liver sausage from lamb, delicious pastured butter and cream, cheese, skyr, lamb, fowl, wild salmon, horse meat, eggs and a variety of shellfish and fish. Thankfully there are markets in and around my city Reykjavík focusing on such produce. On the first day of the challenge I will make a trip to a farm to buy grass fed beef for the freezer along with cream and milk.

Potatoes and white rice are in. These are well tolerated by the gut, tasty and a lot of fun to cook with. They are cheap and help with satiety, which was a big problem in last years challenge.

### Conclusions

I have only been studying nutrition for a year now, and only as a hobby. I'm not an expert by any measure in this field, but applying common sense and keeping an open mind has led me towards a much more balanced diet. I'm also more aware of my responses to particular foods, and it has surprised me how directly I've been able to relate them. The responses are my cues to decrease consumption of a particular offender. I guess that's what people mean by listening to your own body. I just never realized it was a skill you had to work on.

1. <small>Lacto-Paleo never caught on, as recent iterations of the paleo diet definition have embraced cultural foods as "good". *Paleo* is a heavily disputed term. Right as key persons are removing themselves from the term, they seem to be realizing its marketing potential, and cognitive stickiness. </small>
2. <small>20% effort gets you 80% of the results. Relies on actually knowing what you are doing. The flip side is that the last 20% requires 80% of the effort.</small>
